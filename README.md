# Potly

TrueLayer, Barclaycard &amp; Monzo integration to maintain a pot within Monzo equal to your current credit card balance.

## Inspiriation

As a young person, I'm told repeateadly by elders that the wisest thing I should focus on right now is getting an excellent credit score, so that when (if ever!) I'm in the market to buy a house, the banks will provide me a real good loan üè¶

A key component in building your score is ensuring that you **do not miss a payment**.

Now, clearly, to do this, you must have the money to pay off your statement. Yet the purpose of a credit card is to pay with money that you don't yet have. *hmmmm* ü§î

My ideal scenario is if I could treat my credit card like my debit card, then I would never over-spend, and will have the moeny to pay off my bill each month and build that score!

So spawns this tool - designed to maintain a pot within your Monzo account (with scope to expand to other banks/money holders) that holds the current statement balance of your credit card(s).
